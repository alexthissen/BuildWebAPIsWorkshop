# Workshop Building Web APIs using ASP.NET Core 2.2 
## Robust and production ready 

Welcome to the workshop "Building Web APIs using ASP.NET Core 2.2". 

In this workshop you will learn about creating production-ready Web APIs with
This workshop is a living workshop: evolving, maturing and improving. 

The general idea is that you will be able to observe building a ASP.NET Core Web API 
from "File, New Project" to include more and more features that will help running it reliably in production.
The topics that are addressed are:

- Service contract integration testing
- Creating client SDKs
- Health checks
- Instrumentation and telemetry for monitoring
- Versioning
- OpenAPI documentation and Swagger tooling
- Resiliency of external resources (using HttpClientFactory, Refit and Polly)
- Security: User Secrets, HTTPS and HSTS

To get the best experience from the workshop it is recommended that you prepare the following:
- Laptop for browsing around in the code
- Azure subscription to create and use App Services and Application Insights

### Preparing for workshop

Even though you can certainly participate in this workshop without a laptop, 
it will be cool if you can install your development machine ahead of time.

For hosting your API in Microsoft Azure you will need an Azure subscription. 
You can create a trial account if you do not have a subscription available.
Visit https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ to get started with a trial
